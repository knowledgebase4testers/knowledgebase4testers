###  Refactoring 
- in computer programming and software design, code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code — changing the factoring — without changing its external behavior. Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, and/or implementation of the software (its non-functional attributes), while preserving its functionality. Usually, older projects need code refactoring.

###  Regression
- Confirm the regression manually. It is required to measure/test several times to ensure that the regression can be consistently observed.
lower regression [if test number is below base#]
- Higher regression [if test number is above base#]
we don't worry about lower regression => we only worry about higher regression


###  Regression Testing 
- is much more thorough than smoke testing. Regression testing involves checking every possible aspect of the pre-existing app features after a new feature or bug fix is deployed. This is to make sure that the code updates didn't break any other area of the software. Or in other words - a full test of the app.

###  Release 
- A release is the distribution of the final version of an application. A software release may be either public or private and generally constitutes the initial generation of a new or upgraded application.

###  Release candidate 
- is a version that is ready to be released to the public, assuming no major bugs are found during testing.

###  Rollout 
- an informal business term for the introduction and integration of a new product or service to the market. A rollout often refers to a significant product release, which is frequently accompanied by a strong marketing campaign, to generate consumer interest.
