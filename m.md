###  Maintainability: 
- The ease with which the system/software can be modified to correct faults, modified to meet new requirements, modified to make future maintenance easier, or adapted to a changed environment.

###  Maintainability requirements: 
- A specification of the required maintainability for the system/software.

###  Maintainability testing: 
- Testing to determine whether the system/software meets the specified maintainability requirements.

###  Margin 
- it describes the spacing between elements on a (web)page

###  Markdown  
- [GitHub tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

###  Markdown Viewer 
- helps you view Markdown files in Chrome.

###  minicom
- serial communication program that connects to devices through a GNU/Linux PC's serial ports.
- compare to picocom

###  Mobly
- test framework in python
- example use cases:
    * P2P data transfer between two devices
    * Conference calls across three phones
    * Wearable device interacting with a phone
    * Internet-Of-Things devices interacting with each other
    * Testing RF characteristics of devices with special equipment
    * Testing LTE network by controlling phones, base stations, and eNBs

###  Modified condition/decision coverage: 
- The percentage of all branch condition outcomes that independently affect a decision outcome that have been exercised by a test case suite.

###  Modified condition/decision testing: 
- A test case design technique in which test cases are designed to execute branch condition outcomes that independently affect a decision outcome.

###  MobSF 
- a tool for doing a basic automated penetration test on a mobile app.

###  Modal 
- in user interface design for computer applications, a modal window is a graphical control element subordinate to an application's main window.

Users must interact with the modal window before they can return to the parent application.

###  Monsoon
- Device to measure precisely how much power their devices are drawing.

###  Monosnap 
- for taking screenshots on Mac.

###  Multiple condition coverage: 
- See branch condition combination coverage.

###  Mutation analysis: 
- A method to determine test case suite thoroughness by measuring the extent to which a test case suite can discriminate the program from slight variants (mutants) of the program.
- See also error seeding.
