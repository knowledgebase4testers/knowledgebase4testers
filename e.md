###  Edge case 
○ a use case or a situation that can rarely happen, and is often unexpected or overlooked while designing or programming.

###  Emulator: 
○ A device, computer program, or system that accepts the same inputs and
produces the same outputs as a given system. [IEEE,dob]

###  Entry point: 
○ The first executable statement within a component.

###  ENOENT
○ (No such file or directory) Error NO ENTry (or Error NO ENTity) 
○ Typically a "no such file or directory" error. Abbreviated because C compilers at the dawn of time didn't support more than 8 characters in symbols.

###  eSIM
○ Embedded SIM card [not removable] in the phone or motherboard
○ is a programmable chip: while the usual SIM card is passive, eSIM has its own processor.
○ Can use multiple carrier [SIM can’t]


###  environment
There are basically 3 worlds in which a tester can find bugs:
- development
 > The first time a product that looks like and works like the intended design is built. Focused on validating functional correctness (PCB, components, product behavior) and physical characteristics. 
- testing
    > Focused on validating reliability, fit and finish, and certification. 
- production
    > Focused on validating mass production, such as yield, speed, training, tooling, and logistics. The products built during PVT are usually identical to mass production, and are often sold to customers. 
    
Every company might have a different dictum. For instance:
* EVT (Engineering Verification Testing) for development env.
* DVT (Design Verification Testing) for testing env.
* PVT (Production Verification Testing) for when the app is live.



###  EOD (End of the Day) 
○ usually refers to a deadline set by yourself or your project manager

###  Equivalence class: 
○ A portion of the component's input or output domains for which the
component's behaviour is assumed to be the same from the component's specification.

###  Equivalence partition: 
○ See equivalence class.

###  Equivalence partition coverage: 
○ The percentage of equivalence classes generated for
the component, which have been exercised by a test case suite.

###  Equivalence partition testing: 
○ A test case design technique for a component in which test
cases are designed to execute representatives from equivalence classes.

###  Error: 
○ A human action that produces an incorrect result. [IEEE]

###  Error guessing: 
○ A test case design technique where the experience of the tester is used
to postulate what faults might occur, and to design tests specifically to expose them.

###  Executable statement: 
○  A statement which, when compiled, is translated into object code,
which will be executed procedurally when the program is running and may perform an
action on program data.

###  Exercised: 
○ A program element is exercised by a test case when the input value causes
the execution of that element, such as a statement, branch, or other structural element.

###  Exhaustive testing:
○ A test case design technique in which the test case suite comprises all combinations of input values and preconditions for component variables.

###  Exit point: 
○ The last executable statement within a component.

###  Exploratory testing 
○ Testing the the mobile app or website without any specific plan or following formal test cases/suite.
