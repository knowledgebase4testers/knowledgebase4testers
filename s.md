### Scope 
- Total amount of web or mobile features included in the project. 
- Each scope has its duration and budget.

### Scrcpy (Android) 
- a free and open-source screen mirroring application that allows control of an Android device from a Windows, macOS, or Linux desktop computer.
- [Github](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy)

### Scrum 
- is one of the implementations of agile methodology in which incremental builds are delivered to the customer in every two to three weeks' time. Many associate scrum sprints with agile software development, so much so that scrum and agile are often thought to be the same thing. They're not. Agile is a set of principles and scrum is a framework for getting things done.

### Scrum master 
- ensures the team lives agile values and principles and follows the processes and practices that the team agreed they would use.

### SDK (Software development kit) 
- a collection of software development tools in one installable package. They ease the creation of applications by having a compiler, debugger, and perhaps a software framework. To create applications with advanced functionalities such as push notifications, photopay, OCR scanning etc.; most application software developers use specific software development kits.

### Selenium 
- web automation framework built on top of WebDriver.

### Send Anywhere 
- app used to send files between mobile and desktop devices.

### Shortcuts (iOS) 
- is a visual scripting application developed by Apple; use it for creating and executing scripts on your iOS device.

### Simplenote 
- for taking notes.

### SimPPA “Simulate Performance Power Area.” [g3doc]: 
- “Its objective is to align hardware and software around a common understanding of critical gSoC applications. SimPPA can quickly validate hardware and software assumptions”

### Skitch 
- for taking screenshots on your Mac.

### Slack 
- business communication platform.

### Smoke Testing 
- is one of the quickest and most basic forms of testing. It involves doing a simple test of major features, often right before a release. The purpose 
is to see if anything "catches fire", so to speak.

### SOC (battery's state of charge)
- output read on the battery tester.


### Spectacle 
- for managing your app windows on Mac.

### Sprint backlog 
- the collection of tasks defined on the sprint planning meeting, along with their associated product backlog items, forms a second backlog called the sprint backlog.

### Sprint planning 
- performed by the product owner, development team, and Scrum master. The goal is to: determine the most important items of the product backlog to build in the next sprint, break down each targeted feature into a set of tasks, set a sprint goal 
- what the upcoming sprint is supposed to achieve.

### Sprint retrospective 
- a team meeting held after the sprint review. It is an "improvement" meeting attended by all – the product owner, Scrum master, development team members, QA, and only optionally with the stakeholders.

### Sprint review 
- a meeting held (mostly) on the last day of the sprint in which the team presents the results of the sprint to the stakeholders.

### Staging 
- web environment for testing and content before the official production release.

### Stakeholders 
- stakeholders are the purpose for which a product or service is created in the first place. They have certain requirements that need to be fulfilled. It is the responsibility of the Scrum team to fulfill the given requirements of the stakeholders and satisfy them.

### Stetho (Android) 
- is used for examining network traffic, layout, etc. in Android apps via Chrome.

### Story point 
- a metric used in agile project management and development to estimate the difficulty of implementing a given user story.

### Staged rollout (Android) 
- a method of updating an application while reaching only a certain percentage of users (in stages). It enables us to release a single product version very slowly 
- over a certain period of time (counterpart of "Phased rollout").
