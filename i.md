### incremental testing: 
- Integration testing where system components are integrated into the system one at a time until the entire system is integrated.

### independence: 
- Separation of responsibilities which ensures the accomplishment of objective evaluation. After [dob].

### infeasible path: 
A path which cannot be exercised by any set of possible input values.
input: A variable (whether stored within a component or outside it) that is read by the component.

#### input domain: 
The set of all possible inputs.

#### input value: 
An instance of an input.

### inspection: 
A group review quality improvement process for written material. It consists
of two aspects; product (document itself) improvement and process improvement (of both document production and inspection). After [Graham]

### installability: 
The ability of a software component or system to be installed on a defined target platform allowing it to be run as required. Installation includes both a new installation and an upgrade.

### installability testing: 
Testing whether the software/system installation meets defined 
installation requirements. 

### installation guide: 
- Supplied instructions on any suitable media, which guides the installer through the installation process. This may be a manual guide, step-by-step procedure, installation wizard, or any other similar process description.

### installation wizard: 
- Supplied software on any suitable media, which leads the installer through the installation process. It shall normally run the installation process, provide feedback on installation outcomes and prompt for options.

### instrumentation: 
- The insertion of additional code into the program in order to collect information about program behaviour during program execution.

### instrumenter: 
- A software tool used to carry out instrumentation.
integration: The process of combining components into larger assemblies. 

### integration testing: 
- Testing performed to expose faults in the interfaces and in the
interaction between integrated components.

### interface testing: 
- Integration testing where the interfaces between system components
are tested.

### isolation testing: 
- Component testing of individual components in isolation from
surrounding components, with surrounding components being simulated by stubs.


Instruments (iOS) 
- tool for inspecting the performance of your app (and much more). Requires Xcode.
Input field 
- text fields that allow user input. Input can be free text, a number stepper, etc.
Introspect (Android) 
- an app used find all information about your Android device (similar to Inware).
Invision 
- a web interface for browsing design files and prototypes.
Inware (Android) 
- an app that allows you to know your device in detail. You can find information about your device's hardware and software.

### IoT (Internet of Things) 
- is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. For example, smart home systems and devices.

#### ISP 
- Internet service provider.
