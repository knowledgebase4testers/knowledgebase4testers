### Cache (browser cache)
-  A place where web browsers keep copies of previously retrieved files (web pages, data files) in order to save time when they’re requested again. Sometimes, issues may arise if there is a newer version of the file online, but the browser doesn’t notice it.

### Charles 
- A proxy app used for examining network traffic between your device and a server by staging a man-in-the-middle attack.

### Chrome DevTools 
- a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser.

### ChroPath 
- a Google Chrome extension that will help you locate web elements when doing UI automation.

### Chuck(er) 
- is used for inspecting network traffic in Android apps. You can access it from the notifications drawer when the app is running.

### Clear Session 
- a Google Chrome extension that will clear all session/cookie data for a particular web page.

### CMS 
- Content Management System used to manage the creation and modification of digital content.

### Code snippet 
- a code snippet is a small block of re-usable code.

### Cookies 
- are files created by websites you visit. They make your online experience easier by saving browsing information. With cookies, sites can keep you signed in, remember your site preferences, and give you locally relevant content.

### CopyClip 
- simple and efficient clipboard manager for your Mac.

### Crashlytics 
- a part of Firebase; used for getting crash/error logs from mobile apps.

### CTA (Call to Action) 
- refers to a button or other UI element which invites the user to take action on a website or in an app.


### Capture/playback tool: 
- A test tool that records test input as it is sent to the software under test. The input cases stored can then be used to reproduce the test at a later time.

###  CAST: 
- Acronym for computer-aided software testing.

### Cause-effect graph: 
- A graphical representation of inputs or stimuli (causes) with their associated outputs (effects), which can be used to design test cases.

### Cause-effect graphing: 
- A test case design technique in which test cases are designed by
consideration of cause-effect graphs.

### Certification: 
- The process of confirming that a system or component complies with its
specified requirements and is acceptable for operational use. From [IEEE].

### Chow's coverage metrics: 
- See N-switch coverage. [Chow]

### Code coverage: 
- An analysis method that determines which parts of the software have
been executed (covered) by the test case suite and which parts have not been executed
and therefore may require additional attention.

### Code-based testing: 
- Designing tests based on objectives derived from the
implementation (e.g., tests that execute specific control flow paths or use specific data
items).

### Compatibility testing: 
- Testing whether the system is compatible with other systems with which it should communicate.

### Complete path testing: 
- See exhaustive testing.

### Component: 
- A minimal software item for which a separate specification is available.

### Component testing: 
- The testing of individual software components. After [IEEE].

### Component specification: 
- A description of a component's function in terms of its output
values for specified input values under specified preconditions.

### Computation data use: 
- A data use not in a condition. Also called C-use.

### Condition: 
- A Boolean expression containing no Boolean operators. 
- For instance, A<B is a condition but A and B is not. [DO-B]

### Condition outcome: 
- The evaluation of a condition to TRUE or FALSE.

### Conformance criterion: 
- Some method of judging whether or not the component's action
on a particular specified input value conforms to the specification.

### Conformance testing: 
- The process of testing that an implementation conforms to the specification on which it is based.

### Control flow: 
- An abstract representation of all possible sequences of events in a program's execution.

### Control flow graph: 
- The diagrammatic representation of the possible alternative control flow paths through a component.

### Correctness: 
- The degree to which software conforms to its specification.

### Coverage:
- Degree, expressed as a percentage, to which a specified coverage was/is exercised by a test case suite.
