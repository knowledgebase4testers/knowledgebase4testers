      <h3 id="edge-case">Edge case</h3>
<p>○ a use case or a situation that can rarely happen, and is often unexpected or overlooked while designing or programming.</p>

<h3 id="emulator">Emulator:</h3>
<p>○ A device, computer program, or system that accepts the same inputs and
produces the same outputs as a given system. [IEEE,dob]</p>

<h3 id="entry-point">Entry point:</h3>
<p>○ The first executable statement within a component.</p>

<h3 id="enoent">ENOENT</h3>
<p>○ (No such file or directory) Error NO ENTry (or Error NO ENTity) 
○ Typically a “no such file or directory” error. Abbreviated because C compilers at the dawn of time didn’t support more than 8 characters in symbols.</p>

<h3 id="esim">eSIM</h3>
<p>○ Embedded SIM card [not removable] in the phone or motherboard
○ is a programmable chip: while the usual SIM card is passive, eSIM has its own processor.
○ Can use multiple carrier [SIM can’t]</p>

<h3 id="environment">environment</h3>
<p>There are basically 3 worlds in which a tester can find bugs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>development
    <blockquote>
      <p>The first time a product that looks like and works like the intended design is built. Focused on validating functional correctness (PCB, components, product behavior) and physical characteristics.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>testing
    <blockquote>
      <p>Focused on validating reliability, fit and finish, and certification.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>production
    <blockquote>
      <p>Focused on validating mass production, such as yield, speed, training, tooling, and logistics. The products built during PVT are usually identical to mass production, and are often sold to customers.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Every company might have a different dictum. For instance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>EVT (Engineering Verification Testing) for development env.</li>
  <li>DVT (Design Verification Testing) for testing env.</li>
  <li>PVT (Production Verification Testing) for when the app is live.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="eod-end-of-the-day">EOD (End of the Day)</h3>
<p>○ usually refers to a deadline set by yourself or your project manager</p>

<h3 id="equivalence-class">Equivalence class:</h3>
<p>○ A portion of the component’s input or output domains for which the
component’s behaviour is assumed to be the same from the component’s specification.</p>

<h3 id="equivalence-partition">Equivalence partition:</h3>
<p>○ See equivalence class.</p>

<h3 id="equivalence-partition-coverage">Equivalence partition coverage:</h3>
<p>○ The percentage of equivalence classes generated for
the component, which have been exercised by a test case suite.</p>

<h3 id="equivalence-partition-testing">Equivalence partition testing:</h3>
<p>○ A test case design technique for a component in which test
cases are designed to execute representatives from equivalence classes.</p>

<h3 id="error">Error:</h3>
<p>○ A human action that produces an incorrect result. [IEEE]</p>

<h3 id="error-guessing">Error guessing:</h3>
<p>○ A test case design technique where the experience of the tester is used
to postulate what faults might occur, and to design tests specifically to expose them.</p>

<h3 id="executable-statement">Executable statement:</h3>
<p>○  A statement which, when compiled, is translated into object code,
which will be executed procedurally when the program is running and may perform an
action on program data.</p>

<h3 id="exercised">Exercised:</h3>
<p>○ A program element is exercised by a test case when the input value causes
the execution of that element, such as a statement, branch, or other structural element.</p>

<h3 id="exhaustive-testing">Exhaustive testing:</h3>
<p>○ A test case design technique in which the test case suite comprises all combinations of input values and preconditions for component variables.</p>

<h3 id="exit-point">Exit point:</h3>
<p>○ The last executable statement within a component.</p>

<h3 id="exploratory-testing">Exploratory testing</h3>
<p>○ Testing the the mobile app or website without any specific plan or following formal test cases/suite.</p>
